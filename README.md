# A confluence of gaming and programming

Having been a professional developer for two decades i create various scripts and tools for my hobbies outside of work. Having an ability to make a program that can do things to a document/file or to a another webpage is increasingly useful and time-saving.

However i never expected these skills to be applied to gaming. I've always worked on software for large companies and my toolset is mostly in the area of how to build serious-looking user-interface to be used by thousands of people every day on work.

Yet, through various circumstances and deficiences (both mine and game's) i encountered ways to combine these passions of mine into one. Such as:

# God Hand Moveset Switcher

Thanks to **ThereIsNoSpoon**'s [release of moveset switcher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu9XTfZCGTM) we have addresses for where PS2 game stores assigned moves for each of the buttons. Using that, i cobbled up a quick and dirty PCSX2 cheat generator where you can customize movesets:

# The Witness end-game puzzle aid

Final puzzle challenge in The Witness is brutal. Not only it features a number of randomly generated puzzles at you -- you're on a timer too. [One specific type of puzzle was especially hard for me](https://twitter.com/azeke1984/status/1157186715271991296) so using my skills of javascript and basic knowledge of combinatorics i made a javascript fiddle to ~~solve them for me~~ help me in solving them:
